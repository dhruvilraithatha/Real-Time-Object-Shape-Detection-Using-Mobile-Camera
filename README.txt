***YOU HAVE TO RUN "Real Time Object Shape Detection Using Mobile Camera.py" FILE.***

INTRODUCTION:-
In our everyday life we come across various objects of various shapes and with the help of our senses we can easily classify and distinguish among them.

But for a computer, which does not have any sense, we need to train or program it for such a classification or recognition of different objects.

This is a module that will recognize shape of objects in real time using our mobile camera.

Technically it will read frames from mobile camera and then performs various morphological operations to filter frame and recognize objects and then detect the shape of it.
